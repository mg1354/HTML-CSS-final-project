        <p>This week you will be familiar with the recipe of Abgosht, one of the most popular food in Iran.</p>
        <p> Abgoosht is one of the most traditional Iranian foods.</p>
        <p> It is also called Dizi, which refers to the traditional stone crock pots it is served in. Hundreds of years ago Abgoosht was made with lamb and chickpeas. However, later on when new foods such as potatoes and tomatoes were introduced to Iranian Cuisine, the recipe had some changes.
        This recipe is for four people.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
        <p>* 2 lamb shanks</p>
        <p>* 1 Cup white beans, soaked over night</p>

        <p>* 1 large onion</p>
        <p>* 2 tomatoes</p>

        <p>-When meat is almost cooked, remove the tomatoes,
         onion and any fat from the meat and place them in a bowl.</p>
        <p>-Using a blender or meat masher, mash the onion
         ,tomatoes and fat. Add it to the pot again. Add salt, pepper, tomato paste, potato and lemon
